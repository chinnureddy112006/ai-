Got it 👍 You want a **README** file that documents a collection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs (like Prolog programs, search algorithms, diagnosis systems, etc.). I’ll draft a **generic but structured README** that you can adapt for your own AI programs.

# 📘 README – Artificial Intelligence Programs

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs** implemented in **Prolog** and **Python**.
The programs demonstrate fundamental AI concepts such as **search algorithms, knowledge representation, reasoning, and problem-solving techniques**.

The main objective of these programs is to provide **practical examples** for students, researchers, and enthusiasts learning AI.

## 📂 Contents

The repository includes the following categories of programs:

1. **Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (Prolog)**

   * Facts & Rules Database
   * Fruit and Color Knowledge Base (with backtracking)
   * Student–Teacher–Subject Mapping
   * Planetary Database with User Queries
   * Medical Diagnosis Expert System
   * Diet Recommendation System

2. **Problem Solving (Prolog)**

   * Monkey–Banana Problem
   * Forward Chaining
   * Backward Chaining

3. **Search Algorithms (Python/Prolog)**

   * Best First Search
   * A\* Search
   * Depth First Search (DFS)
   * Breadth First Search (BFS)

4. **Mathematical & Utility Programs**

   * Sum of Integers from 1 to N
   * Matrix Addition (Python)

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

* **Prolog** (SWI-Prolog recommended)
* **Python 3.x**

To install:

```bash
# For Prolog
sudo apt-get install swi-prolog  

# For Python (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get install python3
```

## ▶️ How to Run

### **Prolog Programs**

1. Open terminal and start Prolog:

   ```bash
   swipl
   ```
2. Load the program:

   ```prolog
   ?- [program_name].
   ```
3. Run queries. Example for fruit-color knowledge base:

   ```prolog
   ?- color(apple, X).
   ```

### **Python Programs**

1. Run using Python 3:

   ```bash
   python3 program_name.py
   ```

---

## 📊 Example Outputs

**Prolog Query (Medical Diagnosis):**

```prolog
?- diagnose(fever, X).
X = malaria ;
X = flu.
```

**Python (Matrix Addition):**

```
Matrix A + Matrix B = 
[[6 8]
 [10 12]]
```

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Understand how AI systems represent knowledge using **facts, rules, and inference**.
* Apply **search algorithms** to solve real-world problems.
* Explore **expert systems** for decision support.
* Gain hands-on experience with **Prolog reasoning** and **Python search implementations**.

## 📜 License

This repository is for **educational purposes**. You are free to modify and extend the programs.

👉 Do you want me to also create a **separate README template** for **each program** (like “Monkey-Banana Problem README.md”, “Best First Search README.md”, etc.) so each one looks standalone?
